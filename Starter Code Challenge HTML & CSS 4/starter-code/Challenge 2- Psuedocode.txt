Challenge 2: Pseudocode

Let maxNumber represent the biggest number, set it to zero to start
While there are still numbers left in the list
	Look at the next number in the list
	Compare it to the maxNumber
		If next number is smaller than maxNumber
			Set maxNumber to that number
Report maxNumber as the biggest in the list


Solution:

In line 5, it should say the next number is "bigger" than maxNumber rather than smaller as we are looking for the biggest number and we set maxNumber to that number only if it is bigger.
